# AERO-BirdsEye-CLINICAL-RESEARCH

# Description
Maximizing efficiency in drug development is important for drug developers, policymakers, and human subjects.It has been noted that there has been waste and inefficiency which have become big problems. It is also estimated that quite a number of the trials are not completed, while others are entirely not done. All these can be hard to spot, especially when these companies are in the midst of these processes.It is in this view that this study seeks to analyze the records and find out more about the number of trials each sponsor carried out, the conditions that were on trial especially in regards to each sponsor and also the status of trials that were carried out(whether they were completed or not). Our findings will be used by the government  regulatory board to give proper directives to these companies in order to effect change.
# Main Objectives
